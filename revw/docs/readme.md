# Review
At the beginning of a new semester it's always good to review what has gone before. Some of you may have been writing html last week, for others it may have been months ago. This activity is designed to help you 'brush out the cobwebs', so to speak, if any have had a chance to build up.
This assignment is in part to help you assess your readiness for this course. If you struggle to remember the CSS necessary to complete this activity then you should plan on extra time each week as you remediate. All of the HTML and CSS knowledge you will need to complete this was introduced in WDD 130 and 230.
I will provide the html for the activity to save you some time. I am most concerned with having you writing css as soon as possible. You should however carefully reviewthe html file to make sure that you understand the purpose of every line in there.

# Objective:

Refresh and demonstrate skills on media queries and make layouts with css. The layouts should match the mockups in a small browser window or larger browser window.
Activity Directions
Step 1:  Download the htmlfor the page. Then review the mockups for both small andlarge screens. The finished page should match the mockups in layout and styling, be responsive, and validate as html5 and css3. I would recommend building out the small screen first then adjusting for the large view.

# Details
	The font for the headlines is Lora and can be found on Google fonts.
	The font list for the body copy is: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, and the color should be #333.
	You can use #d0d0d0 for the light grey color of the lines.
	Navigation links should behave thus: normal and visited: #666 and no underline , active: #DEB887, hover: #00ddff
	The exception would be the title of the site. It should be a link, but should not have a hover change and should remain the same color of the rest of the text (#333)
	You should be able to do this withoutmodifying the html. Have that as your goal. If you do end up changing the .html file make sure to submit it with your css!
Achieving your goal of notmodifying the html for this assignment will be easier if you remember that there are two ways to include an external font. The first would be to use a <link>tag in the html. That will obviously cause problems with our goal.
The second is to use an @import at the top of the css file.
Google Fonts has the code for both on their site. I would use the @importmethod if I were you ;)
Step 2:  Upload Your CSS file, a screenshot of your finished page in the browser (mobile and desktop), and a screenshot of your css passing validation to ILearn for grading.
